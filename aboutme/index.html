    <h2>Sean Rood</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Sean Rood, but I promise I'm nice. I am originally from Oregon,
        but I currently reside in East Idaho. I am working towards my applied technology bachelors. I started pathway in
        2019 but had to stop in 2020 with an out of state move and job change.
        I am looking forward to geting back into classes again.
    </p>
    <p>I am married, my wife and I will be celebrating our 10th anniversary this year. We have one son. I love spending
        time doing basically anything with my family.
        We are really working hard this year to spend as many hours outside as we can. I also
        really enjoy reading, playing the occasional videogame when I find time.
        I also enjoy role playing games like Dungeons & Dragons.
    </p>
    <p>I am a licensed Funeral Director/Mortician. I have been in the Funeral Industry for 8 years now. There are many
        aspects about my job I love,
        but it can be very hard on my home life and famly. I am looking towards transitioning out of the field upon
        completion of my degree.
    </p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church my whole life. I served a mission in Baltimore Maryland in 06-08. I attended
        BYU-Idaho as an on campus student,
        and my favorite part was being in a place where the secular learning and gospel learning could coexist together.
        Beginning each class with prayer was a great experience. </p>
