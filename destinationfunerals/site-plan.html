        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>There are generally two times where the entire family gets together anymore, Weddings, and funerals. With
            families spread far and wide its hard to find the time together while taking care of the final arrangements
            when a loved one passes. This need not be the case, with Destination Funerals. When you navigate to our
            website you can choose the exotic locale to celebrate the life of your dearly departed, while we arrange all
            the service details. Heal together as you explore and bond as a family while celebrating the life of your
            loved one. I am a licensed Funeral Director with 8 years in the industry. I believe that true healing takes
            place when grief is shared. Let us bring you together and begin the healing process today.</p>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>My intended audience is families. It really encompasses everyone, but I feel the most important group it
            focuses on are the children. At a funeral it can be hard for children to mentally process a death,
            especially with parents and grandparents grieving and struggling through their own feelings there isn’t
            always space to help the littles understand. Destination funerals allows families to get together and
            vacation, while celebrating the life of their loved one. This allows for more time for littles to spend with
            the adults and hopefully opening those lines of communication. </p> <!-- change this -->

        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Sean Rood, I was first introduced to the field after High School. A friends family owned a
            mortuary and I was hired to help out with transfers, working services, cleaning the fleet, and building.
            Once that job ended and I moved on to college I didn’t put too much thought into the death industry until
            2013 when my grandpa died.
            My entire family had planned on going out to Oregon for thanksgiving and my grandpa happened to pass the
            week prior. Since my entire family was already scheduled to be out there, we had all my dads siblings, and
            my cousins. We ended up spending time together at my grandma’s house, the beach, my aunts rental house, and
            had a large thanksgiving dinner together before having the funeral on Saturday. It was a sad time but also
            was fun spending time together and visiting. I hadn’t seen some of my family in years and it was nice
            catching up. Two things happened at this funeral, 1. I realized I wanted to be a funeral director, and 2. It
            planted a seed that would eventually become Destination Funerals.
            I am a licensed funeral director with 9 years in the funeral business. With the skills and knowledge, I have
            attained in my years of service I am qualified to guide your family through the funeral process as we also
            navigate the family through their grief. We also have talented travel agents on hand that know the industry
            and how to get use the best bang for our buck.
