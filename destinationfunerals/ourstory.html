            <p>My name is Sean Rood, I was first introduced to the field after High School. A friends family owned a
                mortuary and I was hired to help out with transfers, working services, cleaning the fleet, and building.
                Once that job ended and I moved on to college I didn’t put too much thought into the death industry
                until 2013 when my grandpa died. My entire family had planned on going out to Oregon for thanksgiving
                and my grandpa happened to pass the week prior. Since my entire family was already scheduled to be out
                there, we had all my dads siblings, and my cousins. We ended up spending time together at my grandma’s
                house, the beach, my aunts rental house, and had a large thanksgiving dinner together before having the
                funeral on Saturday. It was a sad time but also was fun spending time together and visiting. I hadn’t
                seen some of my family in years and it was nice catching up. Two things happened at this funeral,

                <p>1. I realized I wanted to be a funeral director.</p>

                <p>2. It planted a seed that would eventually become
                    Destination Funerals.</p>
